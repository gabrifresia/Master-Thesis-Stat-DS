## Info

Leiden University's "Statistics and Data Science" programme \
Master's Thesis \
Student: Gabriele Fresia  \
Supervisors: Anik√≥ Lovik

## Introduction
The code is separated into two R markdown files named "Cross sectional analyses" and "Time-incorporated analysis". Each file provides the workflow and method for the homonymous study.
A PDF rendition of the R markdown is possible through the "Knit" button, but its rendition is not in optimal format. Thus, the R markdown file is recommended.

The purpose of the code is to provide the implementation of the analyses described in the thesis. 
An explanation of the code is provided. When further explanation is needed, the reader is referred to a specific section in the thesis.

## Prerequisites
A list of packages to be installed can be found within the R markdown files

## Data
The dataset from the CareRA trial is not available to the public and is therefore not included in the repository. 

## Dates
The code is submitted on February 1st 2024 \
The thesis is defended on February 15th 2024
